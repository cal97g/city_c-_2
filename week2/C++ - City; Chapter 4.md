# C++ - City; Chapter 4



Computation

- input (from user, files, other devices, programs)

As programmers our job is to express computations correctly:

- Correctly
- Simply
- Efficiently

Abstraction, divide and coquer, 



## Programming terms



- An `expression ` is something that performs an action?

- A `literal` is a fixed value in source coide



### C++ Types

- `bool`, true or false, represented as 1 or 0; used with logical operators, relational operators return bools
- `char`,  one character, `a`, `b` - character types have single quotes in C++. `'a'`
- `int`, `short`, `long`
- `double`, `float` +, -, / *



Operations performed on these types are `expresions`.



### consice operators

`a += 10 `, `a++`, `a *= 10`



### Statements


research:
- statements
-  type safety, ie std::cin >> number;
